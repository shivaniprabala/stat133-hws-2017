#### Special Kitchen Tools or Spices You May Need

|   Tools    |    Spices   |
|------------|-------------|
| wok        |  garlic     |
| grill      |  pepper     |
| spatula    |  salt       |
| julienne   |  ginger     |



### Steps
1. Add cooking oil to the wok and let it heat up until very hot, but not smoking; cook proteins first(tofu, meat, or seafood based on your preference) until seared and just about halfway cooking through. Then, take out the proteins and set them aside in a bowl. 
2. Add in your desired aromatics (ex. onion, sliced garlic, etc.) and cooking until fragrant.
3. Add vegetables in the order of those taking longest to cook to shortest time.
4. Once the vegetables are nearly cooked through, add in the noodles and about 1 tablespoon of water. The water will help create a bit of steam, which helps the noodles warm up and finish cooking.
5. Add whatever cooking sauce you like!(ex. San-J Mongolian BBQ Cooking Sauce)
6. Add meat/seafood/tofu back in. 
7. Continue mixing until everything is cooked to your desire and you're done!

# The Quadratic Equation 

#### The general form of a quadratic equation is as follows: ${ax^2 + bx + c = 0}$. This formula represents a quadratic polynomial and allows for one to easily solve for the roots of the function; since all variables are on one side and they are set to zero. The quadratic formula is as follows: $x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$, where x represent the two roots of any quadratic polynomial. 


#Comments and Reflections: 

1. Figuring out what type of file to document the assignments on and understanding how to save and submit them properly was difficult for me even though I had seen the Professor walk through them a bit in class.

2. Figuring out syntax was relatively easy even though we didn't go over in class.

3. This was the first time I have used markdown and I feel like at first it was really confusing, but after I worked on it for a while it became easier. 

4. N/A This is the first time I have used markdown. 

5. Yes I needed some help with understanding what certain parts of the lab were asking, and I also felt that it was unclear sometimes what parts were just for us to try in the console and what parts we actually had to turn in. But, my gsi was pretty helpful is clarifying these doubts. 

6. I took 2-3 hours to complete this homework. 

7. The most time consuming part was learning LaTex.
